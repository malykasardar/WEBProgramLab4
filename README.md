# PreLab 4 - AJAX, JSON and Web APIs
The objective of this lab is to introduce students to AJAX, JSON and web API’s by integrating them in
web pages and applications. Web pages and applications created in this lab will create a strong
understanding of the topics explained. In this lab, AJAX, JSON and web API’s will be used to create faster
and better web pages. For this lab we will have different activities and applications to make sure you
understand AJAX, JSON and WEB API’s.
# Activity One: Ajax Introduction
AJAX which stands for (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used to create faster and
dynamic web pages. The main advantage of AJAX is that you will be able to update parts of your page
without refreshing or reloading your whole page. Example: When you like a post or picture on Facebook,
it does not refresh the whole page to show that you liked a specific picture. AJAX is not a programming
language, it is just a technique that exchanges small amount of data with the server. Now we are going
to build a simple web page to demonstrate how AJAX works. We are going to insert a picture and a like
button. Once we click on that button it will tell us that we liked it.

# Activity two: Introduction to JSON
JSON which stands for JavaScript Object Notation which is a lightweight data-interchange
format and it is based on JavaScript syntax. JSON is better and easier to use than XML. It is just
text and used as a data format same as XML. It is usually used to convert into JavaScript objects.
We will demonstrate it by creating an object and using it in javascript. JSON is usually used with
AJAX because it is faster and easier than XML. 
• Now I have learned how to convert a JSON file to actual objects that we can use and
handle in many different ways.

# Lab 4 - AJAX, JSON and Web APIs
# Activity one: Handling JSON data
In this activity we will create a JSON file that contains the name and age of employees in
a certain company. Then we will take this information and place it in a table and view it on
our web page.

# Activity Two: Web API’s
A web API is the application programming interface for the both the web server and web
browser. An API is defined to be as a set of http request messages and response messages such as JSON
or XML. The publishing of web APIs helped many people create applications and sharing content.
Examples of APIs that are commonly used: Google, twitter and Instagram.
This activity will create an application that will use the Nominatim API in which the user will type
a location’s name and the application will print the latitude and longitude of that location. Geocoding is
the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates.
